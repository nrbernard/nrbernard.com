<div id="home" class="content">
	<p>By day, I help make websites better as an SEO strategist at <a href="http://www.portent.com">Portent</a>. By night, I'm learning everything I can about front-end web development so I have something to talk about with the cool kids at work.</p>

	<p>This site will continue to grow, so check back for updates on what I'm learning, results of some side-projects, and poetry.</p>

	<p>I'm building the site with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosting it on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

	<p>If you've got a project that could use my help, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:nick@nrbernard.com">nick@nrbernard.com</a>.</p>
