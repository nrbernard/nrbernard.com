##Control Flow

###$ control_11
If your guilt becomes a symphony—an actual top user-generated playlist—then just enable a private session.

###$ control_10
If I even think of the word *Tuesday*, then it’s like a Palm Desert bungalow—a vacant Tommy Bahama.

###$ control_9
If I imagine your core product, then I want to touch different parts of your organization.

###$ control_8
If we’re talking robust solutions, then I want deep insights into your value chain.

###$ control_7
If the office trees make you want to hang yourself, then you can hang yourself in the office trees.

###$ control_6
If I believe I’ve finally winced enough, then you remind me I’ve let an expensive sandwich go bad in the fridge and show me a photograph of every face I’ve ever made.

###$ control_5
If I say, *I’d like a swimming pool*, then you take me to a well and sweep your arm out in front of you, slowly, *like this*.

###$ control_4
If the mailman sees me again like this, then he’ll know what a sham it’s all been.

###$ control_3
If you shrug, then I want to turn to the mirror and practice my own shrugs.

###$ control_2
If I have to believe in something, then I choose the light of the convenience store sign.

###$ control_1
If I imagine a past for long enough where the thing I'm thinking of never happened, then eventually it didn't.
