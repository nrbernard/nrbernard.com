Nick Bernard Portfolio Site
===========================

This portfolio site will be an ongoing way to show what I'm learning about mobile-first, responsive design and development, Compass, and Sass.

The site is powered by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages, so I'm also learning version control and deployment with Git and GitHub public repositories.
